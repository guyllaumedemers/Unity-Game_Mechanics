# Unity-Game_Mechanics

Welcome to Unity-Game_Mechanics, a repository containning various exercices for improving game development, mechanics and features using Unity and CSharp.
Useful scripts are located in Assets/Scripts/..

## Getting Started

ðŸ‘¾ Fun Repository

```
NOTE : This project is broken down into multiples folders, each representing a step in the development of my programming journey.
```

## Content

* [Assets/Scripts/FlockingAI](https://github.com/guyllaumedemers/Unity-Game_Mechanics/tree/master/Unity-AI/Unity-FlockingAI/Assets/Scripts) : Flocking AI Scripts
* [Assets/Scripts/ComboSystem](https://github.com/guyllaumedemers/Unity-Game_Mechanics/tree/master/Unity-Gameplay/Unity-Fighting_Mechanics/Assets/Scripts) : Combo System Scripts
* * [Assets/Scripts/Algorithm](https://github.com/guyllaumedemers/Unity-Game_Mechanics/tree/master/Unity-Algorithm/Unity-RecursiveBacktracker_Maze/Assets/Scripts) : Iterative Backtracker Scripts

### Game Mechanics and Features

*  Combo System (*WIP*)

```
NOTE : This project has for objective of setting up in place a combo system that register input keys from a players, compare those inputs 
       to a list of posssible combos and toss the last register key inputs if no match are found inside the hashset of unique combos OR perform
       last valid combo if the last input register time is greater than the maxTime allowed to register the next input.
```

### AI Mechanics

*  Flocking AI (*using the Composite Pattern*)

### Algorithms

*  Iterative Backtracker Maze Generation

### Design Pattern and Memory Optimization

*  Composite Pattern

```
NOTE : Resources used to develop these features can be found here.
